City of Rage is a tribute to "Streets Of Rage", and all beat them up 
arcade games from the golden age of video games history (90's).
this sound like the OpenBOR engine, doesn't it ?
for those who doesn't know it: OpenBOR is a game engine for
making beat them up games.
I got the inspiration to do this game when I was reading 
Ultimate Mortal Kombat's leaked source code.
in the development I've used  the MAME emulator to study
the original game (Streets Of Rage 2), you can pause and advance 
frame by frame in any game you play, it's really a great and
helpful feature that I really appreciate.
completing all the characters require a lot of time and effort
so I will just leave it like that for now
and maybe someday when I have the time and desire
I will add more characters.

how to play:
use the arrows keys to move and the following keys:
 H : to attack
 J : to jump
 K : for special attack
 P : pause the game
